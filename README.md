# converter_site

This converter app is built upon a django website that was built in the https://teamtreehouse.com courses on django.
Its sposed to be a site that has courses, different types of questions and answers.

   The converter app does similar what google has which converts different measurements to another like miles to kilometers
or Fahrenheit to centigrade. It has a simple time two converter which doubles any number given to it, temperature converter which converts centigrade to Fahrenheit and visa versa, distance converter which converts between inches, centimeters, feet, meters,
miles and kilometers into any of the other. Also has a shape calculator that calculates the area and surface area of a circle,
triangle, rectangle, trapezoid, sphere, cylinder, pyramid and a cube. Also a tip caculator that similar to an old app on my old
phone that calculates the percent you want to give from the total as a tip and the total amount with the tip.And I also made a
simple calculator that does adding, subtracting multiplication and division. It could take many arguments in one line like
"5 + 3 * 2" but calculates them left to right not according to traditional times before adding.

All of there are built with django using views and returning the answer in a message. It probably would be better to use JS
But It kind of bends the django frame work to see what it could.
