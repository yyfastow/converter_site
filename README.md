# converter_site

     This converter app is built upon a django website that was built in the https://teamtreehouse.com courses on django.
Its sposed to be a site that has courses, different types of questions and answers. But the main point of the project is to work on our django
skills with models and forms ext. It doesn't really do much more then store information and spit it out. This is all in the courses app.

     The converter app does similar what google has which
converts different measurements to another like miles to kilometers or Fahrenheit to centigrade.It has a simple time two converter
which doubles any number given to it, temperature converter which converts centigrade to Fahrenheit and visa versa, distance converter which
converts between inches, centimeters, feet, meters, miles and kilometers into any of the other. Also has a shape calculator that calculates
the area and surface area of a circle, triangle, rectangle, trapezoid, sphere, cylinder, pyramid and a cube. Also a tip caculator that
similar to an old app on my old phone that calculates the percent you want to give from the total as a tip and the total amount with the tip.
And I also made a simple calculator that does adding, subtracting multiplication and division.
IT could take many arguments in one line like "5 + 3 * 2" but calculates them left to right not according to traditional times before adding.
